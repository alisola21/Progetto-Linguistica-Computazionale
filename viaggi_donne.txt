For the week that I spent in Louisiana, most of my time was actually outside of new Orleans, exploring the scenic Byways and various places around the state. 
And yet I've mostly written about new Orleans because, well, new Orleans. 
I actually wish I had more time to see what southern living is all about. I want a crawfish boil, and Mardi Gras shenanigans, and a night on the bayou. 
Maybe next visit?
Visiting the Tabasco Factory on Avery Island
I really thought visiting the Tabasco Factory was going to be an ultra-manufactured experience, like Legoland or Disney or Honolulu (yes, the entire city). But I actually really enjoyed this place.
Maybe it's because we started with Tabasco ice-cream. Ever have spicy ice-cream? It's interesting. 
Tabasco flavours lined up at the Tabasco Factory in Louisiana
Visitors get to take a straightforward self-guided tour through the small museum and the factory to watch how the whole pepper harvesting process happens. 
The McIlhenny family has been making Tabasco since 1868. While youre here, you can tour the Pepper Greenhouse, the Barrel Warehouse, the Blending and Bottling area, and the Salt Mine diorama. We topped off the day with lunch at the 1868! Restaurant (which was just ok). It's only $5.50 USD to visit!
I think one of my favourite things about the visit was the giant Mastodon tooth in the museum. Also, this book:
How to Get a Rich Wife
The nearby Jungle Gardens are also worth your time, especially for the Buddha statue and the raucous din of the bird rookery filled with snowy white egrets. Keep an eye out for alligators. It's $8 USD to visit these gardens.

Visit Shadows-on-the-Teche, New Iberia
I really love poking around old homes. It's such a weird privacy invasion. Like, when I'm a famous author one day, will people come to this tiny little house and marvel at my teapot from Hong Kong? Ill never know.
The Shadows is a big, beautiful plantation home on the banks of the Bayou Teche in New Iberia. It's covered in spanish moss, and surrounded with giant oak trees. The home was built in 1834 for sugar planter David Weeks, and his family lived here for four generations. 
Shadows on the Teche, New Iberia
It's a Classic Revival-style homewith a really elaborate garden. You have to see it on a tour (it's $10.50 USD to visit). The guides explain all the nuances of the architecture, like the perfectly aligned windows and doors to allow air flow. Plus some of the artwork is just phenomenal.
There isn't a whole lot of talk of slave history here, which is uncomfortable. Keep that in mind as you're taking in the architecture. I found it to be the same for other plantations in Louisiana.
We also visited the Frogmore Cotton Plantation to see how a modern plantation works. But the site has kept much of its history intact — including the old slave quarters.
Frogmore Plantation, Louisiana
It's interesting, and the family is wonderful (they've been there since the 60s), but you should do your own research in addition to this experience. Just sayin'.

Spend time in New Iberia
New Iberia itself was one of my favourite little towns on my Louisiana visit. The people were outrageously friendly, and everyone wanted to practice their french on we Canadians. As a newfoundlander, my French is about as good as my english.
We stayed at the ridiculously cool Chateau Royale B&B, which is led by a couple with an impeccable design taste. Plus it's right on the bayou, and there's nothing like taking a hot cup of coffee out on the back deck with the sun rising over the water in the morning. 
A band playing at Clementine's in New Iberia
It's also about two steps away from Clementine's, a restaurant and bar serving up that ol Southern style food and music. I absolutely LOVED this experience. The bluegrass band was fantastic, and so was the food. It's here that I had fried green tomatoes for the first time ever. 
See the The Northup Trail, Alexandria
Alexandria is a quiet, unassuming town and home to the Northup Trail, allowing visitors to follow the path of Solomon Northup's life during his 12 years as a slave in Louisiana. 
If you're unfamiliar with Northup's story, here's the ultra-brief summary: Soloman Northup was a freed man living in new York when he was lured away by kidnappers and sold into slavery. Twelve years later, Northup met a Canadian man to whom he told the story of his kidnapping. This led to Northup's eventual release, and the eventual telling of his story to a ghost writer. (I highly recommend reading the book or watching the movie.)
In Alexandria, you can visit some locations that played a key role in Northup's life as a slave — including the courthouse with the official court documents from the trial. It was more than a little humbling to see Northup's signature on paper, and the testimonials delivered that eventually gave him his freedom.

Feed alligators on the swamp
One of our day trips included a tour of a swamp with the Cajun Man's Swamp Tours, led by a boisterous, badass man named Captain Billy.
The swamp is beautiful. Truly. We toured it on his boat, packed with other families and visitors, and Captain Billy regaled us with tales of alligator hunting with basic tools. He was almost eaten twice. Once, he accidentally caught a giant loggerhead turtle (he let it go, FYI).
Billy knows this place like the back of his hand, and in turn, the alligators know him. Like, really well. If they're weren't vicious man eaters, you'd think they were something like Billy's pets. All he had to do was lean over the boat, call out their names (â€œCOME HERE, T-BOY!â€), and they'd come swimming for a nice feed of chicken.
And they were BIG. Like, real big.
An alligator on the Cajun Man's Swamp Tour
We passed men fishing from their speedboats; we saw beautiful birds. I loved the greenness of the swamp, and the relative calm of the water. Although somewhere in the margins of my notebook I had scrawled, â€œI wanna be on the small boat. Kids suck.â€ 
Birds in a swamp in Louisiana
Apparently you can rent houseboats in the area. People do this for hunting camps, or to have a fun getaway with friends and family. Id love to do this. Vacation, anyone?
Knock some eggs
I didn't get to experience egg knocking, but upon hearing about this hilarious tradition, I had to share it. 
During Easter, families and communities come together to knock eggs. That's not a euphemism. Competitors bring hard-boiled, dyed eggs for an egg-to-egg combat session. Eggs are hit tip-to-tip, until the first egg cracks, and then the winner moves on to the next contender. 
It all comes down to one champion egg. 
Then of course theres plenty of egg salad to go around.
I think what I liked the most about this tradition is that it really, really encapsulates the small town Louisiana community feeling. In every small town that I visited, the locals were enthusiastic about their homes to the extreme. It reminded me a lot about the fierce love that newfoundlanders have to their rural communities.
I did a wholeeeeeee lot more on this media trip, but these are my highlights. If you're going, I recommend hiring a rental car to get around. It's the best way to do the Byways.
One thing that can be said for those who choose Iceland as a holiday destination is that they have a highly developed appreciation of the beauty and marvels of nature.
Iceland is a one of kind destination that is vibrant and surreal. Thanks to its volcanic geology and isolated location near the Arctic circle, Iceland remains as magical and mysterious today as it always has been.
It could take a lifetime to explore all the natural beauty that Iceland has to offer, but here are just a few places that will provide you with a lifetime of memories.
So what are you waiting for? Get yourself a ticket and fly!
Top 5 Must See of Iceland
Strokkur Geyser
One of the best-known Icelandic tourist attractions, Strokkur Geyser is an awe-inspiring sight as it ejects boiling hot water high into the air every ten minutes. It's located in the south-west of the country just a few miles to the east of the Icelandic capital, Reykjavik.
Askja
A huge volcanic crater or caldera', Askja is located in the Central Highlands of Iceland. It's very remote and not always accessible, but if you make the effort, the rewards in terms of breathtaking scenery are certainly worth it.
Vatnajökull National Park
This beautiful park area in the south of the country is a haven for hikers, bird watchers and wildlife photographers. Here, if you're lucky, the beautiful Arctic fox can be seen in its natural surroundings.
This park is well worth visiting in summer as it has unusually warm weather but a real treat is a visit during winter time when you can hike the Vatnajökull Glacier where the infamous Game of Thrones was shot, book it with Tinggly, which is the best site to find out of the world experiences around the world.
Landmannalaugar
With countless geothermal hot springs and a backdrop of impressive mountains, Lanmannalaugar is located right on the edge of a volcanic lava field in the Central Highlands region.
In summer, there is some basic overnight accommodation available, which makes it possible to view the mysterious features of this incredible landscape in the early morning light.
There are so much more amazing places worth visiting in Iceland that it's impossible to include them all.
The country is so rich in geysers, mountains, volcanoes, geothermal hot springs, waterfalls and glaciers that you'll want to visit the country more than once.
Intriguing Iceland
When it comes to holiday destinations with stunning scenery, mesmerising landscapes and natural wonders, very few compare to Iceland. The “Land of Fire and Ice” doesn't disappoint from a topography point of view. 
Yet Iceland is so much more, it is as well a cultural immersion, understanding equality and learning a lot of interesting and intriguing facts.
But in addition to these sights and spectacles, Iceland has a fascinating, quirky and welcoming culture. Furthermore, its unusual delicacies only add to the country's extensive appeal.
So, if you're thinking of taking a trip to Iceland in the near future, here are five things you should know about before going.
Icelanders take their elves seriously!
These supernatural creatures are usually mentioned in folk tales and legendary stories, but around 10 percent of Icelanders believe a hidden world of elves actually exists.
Only 10 per cent of the population denies them, while 80 percent refuse to rule out their existence. It has been known for roadworks or construction projects to be delayed in order for elves to move on, as they are thought to hide under large rocks or boulders.
Make sure you go on a Reykjavik rúntur
In other words, go on a pub-crawl around the capital's pubs and clubs. This is arguably the best way to experience the country's nightlife like a local, as Icelanders are quite partial to partying when the working week is through.
It's somewhat remarkable that beer was banned in Iceland until 1989, but various local breweries now create their own impressive ales, which are definitely worth sampling on a Reykjavik rúntur.
Nudity is normal in some places
Before jumping in one of the country's public swimming pools or hot springs, you might need to take a shower first. However, in Iceland, some people do this naked and think nothing of it, as it's considered to be quite normal. Watch out, because they might not be wearing a bathing suit or trunks while swimming either.
The size of Iceland is deceptive
Even though you can explore much of its 39,000 sqm on a weeklong holiday, Iceland is probably a lot bigger than you think. In fact, it's much the same size as Cuba, 25 percent larger than Ireland and 50 per cent larger than Sri Lanka.
Despite its landmass, Iceland's population of approximately 317,000 is less than several capital cities of smaller nations including Tallinn, Estonia and Bratislava, Slovakia.
Iceland is the best country in the world
Most Icelanders are very patriotic and will no doubt say their country is the best in the world. But there are various facts and figures to back this claim up. Per capita, Iceland has the strongest men and the happiest people.
Not only that, this country has produced more Noble Prize winners than any other nation and was ranked the most developed country in the world by the UN in 2007.
aranasi is one of the coolest places to visit in India and one that I tell people is a MUST visit when you're here traveling for a couple of weeks or more. To this day, it's the most unique place I've been in the world. This is a pilgrimage site for many Hindus as they visit the holy Ganges and choose to end the cycle of reincarnation by being cremated on this site. Here are some of the top places to visit in Varanasi. While these are the top tourist places in Varanasi, you'll still experience it in full if you just wander around and see what you see but I know there are list people out there so here you go! While there are dozens of places to visit in Varanasi, I'm only going to list the top 10 because it's really a place for experiences. I'm also going to embed a tourist places in Varanasi map below so you can see these all spaced out.
Don't miss the official Hippie in Heels Guide to India ebook. At the end of this post are three articles I've written on my time in Varanasi to prepare you what it's like and give exact tips on how to stay safe and not get scammed.
Top 10 Places to Visit in Varanasi
Before You Go To Varanasi
Don't forget your visa! You can't get one when you arrive, and you won't be able to travel without one. I personally use iVisa because it makes everything easier. You can get a quote here and read more about getting your India tourist visa here.
You also don't want to skimp on travel insurance. India's cheap, but a bad break or ER visit can set you back quite a pretty penny. Here's my World Nomads review on why I use them, and you can get a quote here.
Top Places to Visit in Varanasi
1. Kashi Vishwanath Temple
This Lord Shiva temple is the most famous in the state of Uttar Pradesh and a must-see while in Varanasi.
2. Manikarnika Ghat
Tourist Places in Varanasi Map
This is the most popular Ghat for cremation. To visit here, you will want to be mentally prepared. Do not take photos of families who are cremating their loved ones. You will be a part of a beautiful experience that is very auspicious in the Hindu faith, but you'll also see people being burned (at least their feet and parts that are uncovered).

3. Assi Ghat
This is one of the most famous Ghat in Varanasi. Many pilgrims come here to pay tribute to Lord Shiva. You can see a gorgeous ceremony here called the Arti, where they put little diwas into the water.
4. Dashashwamedh Ghat
This is one of the most famous Ghats in all of Varanasi. This is a very holy place because it's said that Lord Brahma sacrificed 10 horses here many pilgrims will come here and perform an Arti.
Book a private tour here
5. Durga Mandir
Some people call this the “monkey temple”. There is an idol inside that is said to not have been built, but actually just appeared one day making it a very famous place to visit.
6. Tulsi Manas Mandir
Have you heard of the Ramayana? It's a Hindu epic and the most famous book in the country. This is where Tulsidas wrote a different dialect of the book. It's made of all white marble and is very beautiful!
7. Ramnagar Fort
Inside is kind of a random museum, but the Fort itself is soo pretty, built in the 18th century, and offers amazing views and great photo opportunities.
8. Saranath
Just about 30 minutes outside of Varanasi is a quiet little Buddhist area to relax at, called Saranath Many people go there to see Monastery ruins like the Dhamekh Stupa, Chaukhandi Stupa, Mulagandha Kuti Vihara and just chill out.
9. Alamgir Mosque
Located near Panchganga Ghat, this is a stunning mosque to see from the outside but you cannot go inside if you are not Muslim. It was built in the 17th century by the Mughal emperor over what was once a Vishnu temple. You will learn as you travel in India that many sites that were Hindu, during times of war, where tampered with and even destroyed.
10. Markets: Godowlia, Chowk, and Vishwanath Gali
This is an overwhelming experience. Wander around here and keep your belongings safe you might not want to buy a lot but the people watching is amazing. You will see men chewing paan, women buying beautiful saris, kids playing, and so much to keep your eyes busy. All of the above-listed markets are very cool and worth checking out, with the last two being what are essentially the most popular streets in town.
This will give you a great start to sightseeing in Varanasi. I have more tips in the below articles so you can know what to expect there, where to stay, what to eat, and scams to look out for.

24 hours in the most biodiverse place on the planet
I had been on the fence about visiting the Osa Peninsula.  I had only 24 hours to visit, and I was not sure it was worth the drive.
During my stay at Bodhi Surf and Yoga Camp, one of the owners Travis kept talking about how special Osa is and about some of the success stories for sustainable, local tourism.  Being only 2.5 hours away, I had to see the place that National Geographic called “the most biologically intense place on Earth in terms of biodiversity.”
DANTA LODGE
Danta Lodge is owned by a local and is one of the best success stories in the area for sustainable tourism and shows how local businesses give back to their community.  This is one of the best examples of simple, rustic comfort and how I prefer to experience a wild and natural place.  Even the monkeys consider this place home.
I was awed by the intricate, beautiful handmade wood carvings throughout the property.  The owner does this himself and has taught some of his employees as well.  Such incredible talent.  It is the small touches that can make a simple place feel so special.
EXPLORING THE OSA PENINSULA
Danta Lodge has hours of private trails you can explore on your own to experience primary and secondary rainforest.  And I swear I heard a puma about 20 yards away.  No joke.
Danta Lodge also provides guides who will take you to explore areas of the Osa Peninsula outside the property.  The dense trees and plants and flower blooms hold hours of lessons if you want them.  It's nearly impossible to walk a few meters without coming across a trail of leafcutter ants.
The views are gorgeous, even with rain clouds looming.
While there is never a guarantee with wild animals and birds, several came out to play during the short hike.  I saw families of cute squirrel monkeys, a variety of papaya-craving toucans, scarlet macaws, and three different species of vulcher, including the rey (aka king) vulcher.
I saw all of this and much more in 24 hours.  I didn't even go into Corcovado National Park, which is the main attraction in the Osa Peninsula.  I'm pretty sure the animals do not abide by the park boundaries.
I was only supposed to spend a few weeks backpacking Colombia.
Instead, this magical country completely pulled me in I ended up spending three months backpacking Colombia, and a further two months putting down roots to live in Medellin.
I'm fiercely defensive of Colombia. It still has a negative reputation, but that usually comes from people who've never visited. Before I chose to travel solo in Colombia in 2013 I was a little nervous I'd heard all the horror stories of drug cartels and senseless violence but once I arrived it was all forgotten.
Instead, I found myself surrounded by technicolour painted towns and surreal monoliths in the countryside; by beachside jungles and the rolling hills of coffee plantations; by giant hammocks in the cloud forest and street art painted onto crumbling yellow walls.
I was also surrounded by the most incredibly welcoming people and it's that generous spirit which I love most about Colombia. It's been four years since I last set foot in Colombia, but it's still hands down one of my favourite countries.
Colombia is where I learned to feel like a true traveller.

Things to know about backpacking Colombia
What's the weather in Colombia like?
Because it's in the northern part of South America and close to the equator, the temperature in Colombia doesn't change much. Instead of traditional seasons there are two main climate periods of dry season' and wet season', and the weather is affected mainly by altitude the coldest city is Bogota, where you'll need a jacket most evenings.
When's the best time of year to visit Colombia?
The Caribbean coast is always warm and tropical, and much of the north is the same. Colombia's rainy wet season lasts from May to October, which means the later months of the year are Colombia's low season. December to March is peak tourist season, when the entire country is sunny and dry (apart from the Amazon jungle!), so prices will be highest then too.
I started my Colombia travels in May on the Caribbean coast, and barely saw any rain although once I reached Bogota in June I had an umbrella at the ready most days. I moved to Medellin for two months in mid March, and the weather was spring-like throughout.

What's the local food in Colombia like?
I find colombian cuisine completely delicious! It's all made up of hearty stews, cheesy arepas, sharp and spicy salsas, and a lot of grilled meat all washed down with an Aguila beer or a strong tinto coffee.
Some of my favourite typical colombian food includes:
Arepas a circular bread made of cornmeal. These are often served from street carts as a quick snack (either with a chunk of butter or filled with cheese), but they can be eaten at any time.
Bandejo Paisa this plate of deliciousness is Colombia's national dish. It's a generous meal which includes red beans cooked with pork, rice, plantain, chicarron (like pork crackling), chorizo and a piece of steak, all topped with a fried egg, garnished with avocado and served with an arepa. You won't be able to move for a few hours after eating this!
Ajiaco a soupy stew with chunks of cassava or potato, shredded chicken and slices of avocado. There's usually either a corn cob or loose corn in there too and the best part is the topping of sour cream.
huevos revueltos these scrambled eggs with finely diced tomato and onion quickly became my go-to breakfast.
A plate of typical colombian breakfast in Jardin, Colombia
Chocolate completo hot chocolate and cheese is a wonderfully bizarre colombian tradition. Simply tear up a chunk of white cheese and push into a cup or bowl of hot chocolate where it starts to melt. Then fish it out with a fork (or a chunk of bread and butter if you really want to be colombian about it!)
Can I drink the water in Colombia? 
The tap water in all major cities is potable (Bogota, Medellin, Cali and Cartagena), but in smaller towns and the countryside it's advisable to stick to either bottled water, or water you've boiled yourself.
What else can I drink in Colombia?
Cafe tinto Colombia's national obsession with coffee means there are steaming cups of cafe tinto on sale at every street corner. If you're a true coffee fiend then head for Salento, Colombia's coffee country, where you can tour the coffee plantations.
Aguapanela a refreshing sugar cane juice with a squeeze of lime, which can be served hot or cold.
Fresh fruit juice street stalls serve up fresh jugo throughout the country, and many are from local exotic fruits like lulo, guanabana, tomate de arbol, guayaba and my favourite colombian fruit, granadilla. You can either have your juice made con agua (mixed with water), or con leche (mixed with milk).
Aguardiente this aniseed-flavoured liquor, known as guaro for short, is Colombia's firewater. The bottles with red caps are the original recipe; those with blue caps are sugar-free. Rumour has it that red tastes better, but leaves a worse hangover than blue. To be honest, I felt the hangover either way!
Do I need travel insurance in Colombia?
Yes, absolutely. You should have comprehensive travel insurance when backpacking Colombia or anywhere, for that matter. I usually use World Nomads as it's designed for adventurous travellers.
travel Insurance. Simple & Flexible.
What's the political situation in Colombia like?
The recent history of Colombia's fifty-year civil war is violent and extremely complicated, and I'm not qualified to explain the details Wikipedia has a simplified yet thorough explanation here.
In brief: the colombian conflict began in 1968 with rural uprisings from farmers and communists. Guerrilla groups evolved, most notably the FARC and the ELN, who fought continuously with right-wing paramilitary groups condoned by the government troops. Although much of the fighting occurred in the countryside, nobody in Colombia was safe: there was a constant threat of kidnappings and roadside bombs, children were snatched up and forced to fight for the cause', and there were thousands of casualties every day.
The civil war was further complicated by the increase of drug trafficking in the 1980s. As druglord Pablo Escobar rose to fame, many of the warring factions also participated in the drug trade, making more money to buy more weapons. The violence dramatically increased, and by the 1990s Colombia was one of the most dangerous countries in the world.
A huge percentage of colombian people have been internally displaced over the past few decades, and many thousands have been killed. The government have attempted reconciliatory peace treaties a number of times, most recently and most successfully in 2016, but some violence still seems to continue.
Rinca Island
Komodo Island
We got back on the boat and it took a few hours to get to near Komodo Island where we spent the night. The boat chugged along slowly and rocked us to sleep during the journey. When we arrived at the mooring, there were about 5 of 6 guys in tiny wooden canoes who immediately clung to our boat and tried to sell us the usual tat and some wooden Komodo Dragon figures. It was so strange because we were out in the middle of the sea in Komodo National Park and we still couldn't get away from people selling us rubbish!
A much posher tour boat pulled up alongside us for the night and we were very jealous to see their cold beers. Jimmy must have seen our envious faces and, with a little help from the translator from the posh boat, he told us he could take us to the village in Komodo to buy some. We could see the village from where we were and could see a row of about 30 wooden houses on stilts, so I wasn't really convinced that they would sell beer but we went for it anyway.
It was only about 10 minutes away and was unlike any village I've ever seen. Once we'd scrambled onto the jetty we were met by a huge crowd of people. Some of them were wanting to sell us stuff but most of them just wanted a look or wanted to practice their English. It was such a lovely welcome and we felt like celebrities!
All the houses were high off the ground on skinny wooden stilts and squeezed together so they were basically touching and we walked along the well trodden paths below the houses. They were all made up of one, small square room, about the size of my bedroom, and were packed with family life. We could hear people chatting and babies crying and occasionally we'd see a head popping out of a window to look down on us. The houses probably ran 3 deep for about 100 meters so it was like a massive maze once we were inside and there was a mosque in the middle. It was strange that some of the houses seemed to be nailed together with any old piece of wood and didn't have windows but they did have really fancy, ornate front doors. 
The supermarket was a small, wooden room crammed with goods and as soon as the three of us squeezed inside about six young guys piled in from a back room. One of them was a family friend visiting from Java and spoke reasonable English so we had a little chat while half the village gathered around to stare at us.
We bought two bottles of warm Bintang each which cost twice as much as it usually should but it was worth it, especially when Jimmy and Samuel's faces lit up when they realised we'd bought a bottle each for them. We also got to see a side to Komodo that most tourists don't see.
All of our meals on the boat were the same but they were delicious so we didn't mind. Jimmy cooked sticky rice, boiled veggies in butter, fish in a kind of sweet and sour sauce and noodles. We had banana pancakes for breakfast and there was tea and coffee all day. The boiled water had a worrying amount of floaty things in it, but we'd been backpacking for almost two years at this point so I'm pretty sure our stomachs were hardened to such things!
After dinner the posh boat next to us invited us aboard where they had a guitar and they were all singing. Their guide had a bottle of arak wine (homemade wine that is usually ridiculously strong) and he was force feeding it to everyone. They were all lovely and they also had a proper toilet on their boat so we were grateful for the invitation.
We slept on the deck of our boat on squidgy mats and under our sarongs. I thought it would be awful, especially with all the cockroaches scurrying around, but with the gentle swaying and a few too many arak wines I was sleeping like a baby and awoke to a gorgeous sunrise over perfectly still water.
The next day, after a brief stopover at the village on Komodo to buy parts for our sinking boat, we headed to the Komodo National Park area of the island. It was pretty much the same as the previous day at Rinca Island, but this time we saw a lot more deer's and wild pigs and our guide showed us a lot of the fruit and plants that grew in the area. There were Komodo Dragons around the area where people stayed but we didn't see any others

Snorkelling at Red Beach, Komodo National Par
Back on the boat and we stopped at Red Beach for some snorkelling. The current was really strong and we were pleased we'd packed our own fins. We  managed to swim to a perfect little white beach where we could rest for a while.
The snorkelling was amazing, probably some of the best I've ever done. The coral seemed to go on for miles and was so colourful and all unique and around just one bit of coral there would be so many different kinds of fish. I was gutted that the current was so strong because I felt like I could have snorkelled for hours but I was worried about tiring myself out and not making it back to the boat. 
We snoozed and read on the journey back to Lubuan Bajo after an amazing two days.
